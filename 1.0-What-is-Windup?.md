Windup is a tool to simplify Java application migrations.  Run from the command line, the tool analyses artifacts from Java applications and produces an HTML report highlighting areas that require changes. The analyzer is driven by customizable and extendable rules to provide as much information as required to assist developer in migrating applications. Its initial focus is Java EE applications but the Windup design and rule organization is general enough to allow Windup to be used for practically any kind of migration. 

## 1.1 How does Windup simplify migrations?

Windup is comprised of resource interrogators.  These interrogators look for common resources and highlight technologies and known “trouble spots” in migrating applications.  The goal of Windup is to provide a high level view into relevant technologies in use within the application, and provide a consumable report for organizations to estimate, document, and migrate Java EE applications to JBoss.

Below is a list of the interrogators included with Windup:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<tr><th>Interrogators</th><th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td>Java Interrogator</td>
<td>Reads compiled Java files; determined if blacklisted classes are imported, and if so it will continue to profile the resource.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>JSP Interrogator</td><td>Reads JSP files; extracts JSP import and taglibs in use and continues to profile the resource.</td></tr>
<tr><td>XML Interrogator</td><td>Reads XML files; reads the XML into a DOM object and continues to profile the resource.</td></tr>
</table>
