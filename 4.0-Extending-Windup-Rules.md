In an effort to reduce the overhead in testing out Windup configurations, you can use the Windup Extension framework.

The Windup distribution contains a folder called `jboss-windup/rules/extensions`. Within that folder, extensions to Windup can be added to different pipelines, such as the XML or Java rule pipelines.


    <windup:pipeline type="JAVA" id="java-extension-decorators">
        <windup:java-classification regex="com.example.clz.ClzName$" description="Testing Extension Framework" />
    </windup:pipeline>

    <windup:pipeline type="XML" id="xml-extension-decorators">
        <windup:xpath-classification description="Windup Example" xpath="/windup:example">
            <windup:namespace prefix="windup" uri="http://windup.com/example/namespace" />
        </windup:xpath-classification>
    </windup:pipeline>

To plug in a new extension, simply define a new XML file within the extensions folder. The file must use the the file extension `.windup.xml`.
