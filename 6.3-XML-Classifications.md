![XPath Classification](img/6-resource-classification.png)

XML Classification is easy with Windup Rules! XPath expressions are used to select the node:

    <windup:xpath-classification description="Weblogic EAR Application Descriptor" 
        effort="3" 
        xpath="/*[local-name()='weblogic-application']" />

## 6.3.1 XPath Classification

Using the xpath-classification, Windup will read an XML file, and try and match the XPath expression.  If the XPath expression is met, the file will be classified using the description provided.  

    <windup:xpath-classification description="Apache Beehive Configuration" xpath="/b:netui-config | /netui-config">
        <windup:namespace prefix="b" uri="http://beehive.apache.org/netui/2004/server/config" />
    </windup:xpath-classification>

The full schema can be found in the ([windup.xsd](https://github.com/jboss-windup/windup/blob/master/src/main/resources/namespace/windup.xsd)). We'll run through the key elemen ts and attributes here:

<dl>
<dt>description (string)</dt>
<dd>the classification to define the XML if the XPath matches</dd>
<dt>effort (int)</dt><dd>number of story points to implement estimated changes</dd>
<dt>xpath (xpath)</dt><dd>XPath expression to match against</dd>
</dl>

### 6.3.1.1 XPath Namespaces
Note that the `windup:namespace` tag can be used to provide one or more namespace prefix to uri mappings.  All namespace prefixes in the xpath expression must have a cooresponding `windup:namespace` tag.

Nested elements on the XPath Classification include:
* `windup:namespace`
* `windup:hints`
* `windup:decorators`

## 6.3.2 DTD Classification

If the XML uses legacy DTD schemas you can use the Windup dtd-classification.  This allows you to classify XML elements using regular expressions to match the XML's DTD properties.

    <windup:dtd-classification description="Castor JDO Config" effort="0"
        public-id-regex=".+Castor JDO Configuration.+" />

Attributes on the DTD Classification include:
<dl>
<dt>description (string)</dt>
<dd>the classification to define the XML if the regex's match</dd>
<dt>effort (int)</dt>
<dd>number of Story Points to implement estimated changes</dd>
<dt>name-regex (regex)</dt><dd>applies the regex against the DTD's name attribute</dd>
<dt>public-id-regex (regex)</dt>
<dd>applies the regex against the DTD's publicId attribute</dd>
<dt>system-id-regex (regex)</dt>
<dd>applies the regex against the DTD's systemId attribute</dd>
<dt>base-uri-regex (regex)</dt>
<dd>applies the regex against the DTD's baseURI attribute</dd>
</dl>

Nested elements on the DTD Classification include:

* `windup:hints`
* `windup:decorators`

## 6.3.3 Nested Decorators and Hints

Just like in the Java Classification, XML Classifications support nested `windup:hints` and `windup:decorators`.  In the example below, if the xpath expression `/wsdl:definitions` matches on the XML file, the XML will be classified as a "WSDL Definition", and within the resource report, the link "CXF WSDL2Java Generator Documentation" will link to documentation on how to generate Java code from the WSDL file.  Because the link decorator is nested within the classification, the link decorator will only apply when the classification is met.


    <windup:xpath-classification description="WSDL Definition" xpath="/wsdl:definitions" effort="0">
        <windup:namespace prefix="wsdl" uri="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/" />
        <windup:hints>
            ...
        </windup:hints>
        <windup:decorators>
            ...
            <windup:link url="http://cxf.apache.org/docs/maven-cxf-codegen-plugin-wsdl-to-java.html"
                 description="CXF WSDL2Java Generator Documentation" />

        </windup:decorators>
    </windup:xpath-classification>
