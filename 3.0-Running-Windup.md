## 3.1 Running Windup
First, let's talk about what Windup can run against...

Windup can run against both Source projects, and also Compiled projects.  In order to execute against Compiled projects, you are required to have a decompiler installed, and Windup must be able to communicate with the Decompiler.  Since there aren't any open source decompilers that support Java 1.5, Windup does not package a decompiler.

## 3.2 Command Line Arguments

* From the command line:  `java -jar windup-cli.jar`
	* `-input <file>` or `<dir>`   file / directory of files to generate windup reports (required)
	* `-javaPkgs <string>`         client Java packages to target for inspection, separate packages with ":" (required)
    * `-output <dir>`              directory where to generate windup report
    * `-captureLog <boolean>`      persist to file
    * `-fetchRemote <boolean>`     fetch remote POMs for unknown JAR files; if you are running Windup without an internet connection, this can be set to false.
    * `-logLevel <string>`         log level for root logger (defaults to info)
    * `-targetPlatform <string>`   target platform
    * `-source <boolean>`          whether to run in recursive folder mode, against Java, JSP, and XML files.  By default, Windup tries to run on compiled Class files.  This allows Windup to run against Java files.  The output parameter is required for this setting.

## Examples:

### Batch Run (most common):
**Description:** the following will run Windup against all Zip type archives in the folder following "-input", and will analyze classes in the org.example and org.another packages. **Note:** the "-output" parameter is ignored in batch mode.

`java -jar windup-cli.jar -input C:\Users\bdavis\Projects\migrations\example -javaPkgs org.example:org.another`

### Single Run:
======================
**Description:** the following will run Windup against the specific Zip following the "-input", and the report will be output in the "-output" directory.

    java -jar windup-cli.jar -input C:\Users\bdavis\Projects\migrations\example.ear \
        -output C:\Users\bdavis\Projects\migrations\example\example-doc -javaPkgs org.example:org.another
