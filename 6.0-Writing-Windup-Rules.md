Windup is a platform for creating migration rules.  We provide profilers, and you code rules to the profilers.  Some of the most important rules are **classifications** and **inline hints**.  

### Classifications
Classifications are important because they tell developers very quickly ***what*** the resource is, so that they can quickly identify resources of importants.  For example, say you are responsible for migrating an application from Weblogic to JBoss... wouldn't it be nice to know that project is a Spring project?  Wouldn't it be nice to have the Weblogic descriptors identified and called out to us?  This is what classifiers do.  They identify resources, and add a classification to the resource.

Out of the box, it is **very** simple to add classifications for Java and XML files.  The Windup team has found that this covers a large majority of JEE application resources.
